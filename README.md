# Rust Katas: A log of my practice in Rust.

I will mostly be following the examples by Dave Thomas at [http://codekata.com](http://codekata.com) but will probably also sprinkle in some fun activities for video games like Kerbal Space Program or EVE Online. I will also follow a Test Driven Development pattern, where attempted solutions begin first with a specification in a unit test.
